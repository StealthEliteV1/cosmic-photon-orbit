# Cosmic Photon Orbits

## Interactive 3D Black Hole Photon Simulation

This project presents an interactive 3D simulation of photon behavior around a black hole, showcasing the fascinating effects of gravity on light in extreme cosmic environments.

## Features

- **Real-time 3D Visualization**: Watch as photons orbit, fall into, or escape from a black hole.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust various aspects of the simulation in real-time.
- **Color-coded Photon Behavior**: 
  - Red: Photons falling into the black hole
  - Yellow: Photons orbiting in the photon sphere
  - Blue: Photons escaping the black hole's gravity
- **Interactive Camera**: Observe the simulation from different angles as the camera rotates around the scene.

## How to Use

1. Visit the live simulation: [Cosmic Photon Orbits Simulation]((https://stealthelitev1.github.io/cosmic-photon-orbit/))
2. Use the control panel on the right to adjust simulation parameters:
   - Photon Count: Change the number of photons
   - Black Hole Radius: Adjust the size of the black hole
   - Orbit Radius: Modify the initial orbital distance of photons
   - Camera Distance and Speed: Change your view of the simulation
   - Gravitational Strength: Alter the black hole's gravitational pull
   - Photon Colors: Customize the appearance of different photon behaviors
   - Star Color: Change the background star field color
   - Show/Hide Black Hole: Toggle the visibility of the central black hole

## Technical Details

This simulation is built using:
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- dat.GUI for the user interface controls

The project demonstrates concepts such as:
- Gravitational effects on light
- Particle systems in 3D space
- Real-time physics calculations (simplified)

## Limitations

This is an artistic representation designed for educational visualization. It does not accurately model the full complexities of general relativity or actual black hole physics.
